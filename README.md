# New-York-Taxi-and-Limousine-Commission-Data
Here, I loaded the NYC Green Taxi Trip Records data into a data frame. I explored the data to identify any patterns and analyzed the relationships between the features and the target variables.

Some of the key features of this project are: 
• Explored libraries in R Studio such as tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, lubridate, psych, scales, corrplot, etc
•  Analyzed : 1) the distribution, 2) the correlations 3) missing values and 4) outliers — provided supporting visualizations and explained all the steps
• Visualized data in the form of bar graphs, box plots, and line graphs
• Converted different non-numeric columns into numeric ones
• Represented the correlation between the different columns of the data frame by using Pearson's method.
• Constructed a new features and created new columns
• Preprocessed the data to handle missing data and outliers, performed suitable data transformation steps, and filtered the data. 
• Normalized the data: performed max-min normalization and z-score standardization on the continuous variables/features
• Encoded the data to determine if there are any categorical variables that need to be encoded and performed the encoding.
• Prepared the data for modeling to shuffle the data and split it into training and test sets.
• Used k-Nearest Neighbor algorithms to make predictions
